## Basic EDA 
- I have done basic inspection like dataset statistics, which told me that my dataset has both numerical and categorical columns.
NUMERICAL COLUMNS- ['Time_spent_Alone', 'Social_event_attendance', 'Going_outside', 'Friends_circle_size', 'Post_frequency']
CATEGORICAL COLUMNS-['Stage_fear', 'Drained_after_socializing', 'Personality']

1. Time_spent_Alone: Appears to have some outliers at 0 and 11, but these are likely valid as they represent min/max hours.
2. Social_event_attendance: Some values beyond the main range, could be outliers but also valid.
3. Going_outside: Similar to Time_spent_Alone, values at min/max could appear as outliers.
4. Post_frequency: Values above ~7-8 appear as outliers. Again, could be genuine.
